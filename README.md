# exdoodle-react
UI/UX Container (React V16) Ramblings in graphical presentation of Data.

Initial Commit and Project Creation
  - Immediate Needs:
      1. Docs
      2. Tests
      3. Accompanying Server implentations for preferences other than Flask.
  - Next:
      1. Contributors and Discussions.  Please!  The idea here, is a fully open and collaborative venture into integrating Data Visualization
      tools into modern javascript frameworks, whatever the flavor might be.  The choice of React as a first commit was simply
      a matter of a coin flip.


This project is in a very raw initial form.  The server acts as an intermediary and storage facility for free publicly available data API's.
Currently alphavantage.co for Stock Exchange data and the NY Times 'archive_api' for news headlines.

Please Standby for updates.
