UI/UX Container (React V16) Ramblings in graphical presentation of Data.

Initial Commit and Project Creation
  - Immediate Needs:  
      1. Docs 
      2. Tests
      3. Accompanying Server implentations.
  - Next:
      1. Contributors and Discussions.  Please!  The idea here, is a fully open and collaberative venture into integrating Data Visualization
      tools into modern javascript frameworks, whatever the flavor might be.  The choice of React as a first commit was simply
      a matter of a coin flip.
      
      
This project is in a very raw initial form.  Currently it requires a full server implementation that has yet to be added to Github.
The server acts as an intermediary and storage facility for free publicly available data API's.  Currently Alphaadvantage.com 
for Stock Exchange data and the NY Times 'archive_api' for news headlines. 

Please Standby for updates.
